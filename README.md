# Rails Framework

After creating a dozen or so Ruby on Rails app, I realized I was using the same configuration over and over again. This boilerplate code is intended to simply save time building a Rails 5.0+ app.

## Getting Started

You'll need to do a few things to get up-and-running.  Here are a few items:

* Install all the necessary gems with ```bundle install```
* Modify ```config/database.yml``` with a new database name.
* Update your database with ```rails db:wipe```
* Start your web server with ```rails server:start```
* Create an account with [http://mailgun.com](http://mailgun.com) and update your SMPT data in ```config/environments/development.rb```.
* Change your ```ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE']``` [Source](https://matt.aimonetti.net/posts/2013/11/30/sharing-rails-sessions-with-non-ruby-apps/)

#### Cliff's Notes

If you want to see an itemized list of modifications, I suggest reviewing the cliff notes within ```lib/tasks/app.rake```


#### OmniAuth Data

# Managing Tests

### Populating and Testing

Destroy and rebuild the test database with test data
```language-powerbash
rails db:wipe RAILS_ENV=test --trace
```

Migrate the test database
```language-powerbash
rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test --trace
```

Simply populate the test database with seed data. This is the alternative to ```fixtures```.
```language-powerbash
rails db:seed RAILS_ENV=test --trace
```
